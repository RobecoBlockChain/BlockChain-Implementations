# Ethereum

To start the node.js server, our generic API, go in cmd to the /Controller folder.

Type: node server.js

This sets up a port that listens on http://localhost:8081/.

For now all the coding has been done in server.js, and we do not use the ethereumAPI.js file yet.

More documentation coming soon...
